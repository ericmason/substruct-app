Fixed some problem with editing tags and editing sections (AJAX). 
There are other problems which I encountered in relation to ajax features like add to cart but I have not added the changes. In case you experience problems, regarding add to cart and other ajax features, do send me a message.

Minor changes. Deprecation warning on content_node list. 


Final Notes:

I also recommend using Spree e-commerce app which supports several payment gateways apart from Paypal and Authorize. 
What is basically important in every e-commerce application or any application I should say is the flexibility and the ability make changes easily as needed. 

Every client or every project is different. To be high or even a mid-level web developer, you need to have the ability to meet client requirements and not give them something very generic. 

It would be great to create an e-commerce application that would work with Ruby 1.9.1 and Rails 2.3.2 or edge rails. 
Rails 2.2.2 by itself is powerful because you can take advantage of the built-in internationalization feature, thanks to Sven Fuchs and company.
